# Nathan's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository showcases my skills and hands-on experience in various cybersecurity domains. I am a recent graduate of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, and I am passionate about protecting digital assets and mitigating security risks.

## Professional Statement

My name is Nathan. I am a detail-oriented application developer with proficient knowledge of Python, who enjoys learning and expanding my skills. I have a strong interest in the cybersecurity field and value integrity, which helps me maintain confidentiality and trust when handling sensitive security matters. I believe my experience in testing and debugging applications will help me identify and fix potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, directly contributing to an organisation's risk reduction goals. I also have a keen interest in emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and look forward to exploring their role in addressing security challenges in automated systems. My project management experience will assist me in ensure security initiatives are completed properly and on time, helping organisations protect their digital assets. I'm thrilled to apply my knowledge and skills to the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, demonstrating my practical cybersecurity skills:

### [SQL for Security](./sql-for-security/)

This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to query databases for security-related information. I investigated suspicious login attempts, filtered data based on various criteria, and identified employees for security updates.

### [Python for Automation](./python-for-automation/)

In this project, I wrote a Python script to automate the process of updating an access control list. This showcases my ability to use Python to automate repetitive security tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy.

### [Incident Response](./incident-response/)

This project highlights my skills in incident response. I analyzed network traffic to identify a DDoS attack, determined the root cause, and recommended mitigation strategies.

### [Linux Permissions](./linux-permissions/)

This project demonstrates my understanding of Linux file and directory permissions. I identified and corrected insecure permissions to enforce the principle of least privilege.

### [Vulnerability Assessment](./vulnerability-assessment/)

This project showcases my ability to conduct a vulnerability assessment. I identified and assessed vulnerabilities in a system, and I recommended remediation actions to improve the security posture.
